The solution involves using React's Suspense component to handle asynchronous loading more gracefully.  We also implement more robust loading state management to provide clear visual feedback to the user while the component loads.  This helps reduce the likelihood of race conditions causing rendering issues.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

const DynamicComponent = lazy(() => import('./DynamicComponent'));

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
      <DynamicComponent/>
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

By using `Suspense`, Next.js will handle the asynchronous loading and only render the component once it's fully loaded.  The `fallback` prop provides a visual indicator to the user during loading.  This eliminates the need for manual state management and reduces the risk of race conditions disrupting the rendering process.

# Next.js 15 Server Components: Intermittent Rendering Failure

This repository demonstrates a rare bug in Next.js 15 involving server components, dynamic imports, and potential race conditions. The bug causes intermittent rendering failures, where a dynamically imported component fails to load correctly, resulting in blank spaces or errors in the UI. This behavior is not consistent and can be difficult to reproduce.

## Bug Description

The issue occurs when dynamically importing a component within a deeply nested server component structure.  The timing of component mounting and data fetching appears to be a significant factor. The problem is more likely to surface when client-side data fetching is involved, leading to race conditions between data arrival and component rendering.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate through the application, observing for rendering failures (blank areas or errors) in the `MyComponent` area.  Refreshing the page may also help trigger the issue.

## Solution

The solution focuses on resolving the race conditions and ensuring reliable component loading.  This includes using suspense and a more robust loading state management mechanism.

In Next.js 15, a particularly unusual bug can occur when using server components with dynamic imports within a deeply nested component structure.  The issue manifests as intermittent rendering failures where the dynamic component is not properly loaded, leading to blank spaces or errors in the UI.  This does not happen consistently, appearing only sometimes during page navigation or re-rendering. The root cause seems to be related to race conditions in the server component lifecycle, especially when combined with heavy client-side data fetching.

```javascript
// problematic component
export default function MyComponent() {
  const [dynamicComponent, setDynamicComponent] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const loadComponent = async () => {
      const module = await import('./DynamicComponent');
      setDynamicComponent(module.default);
    };
    loadComponent();
  }, []);

  if (!dynamicComponent) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  return <dynamicComponent/>;
}
```
